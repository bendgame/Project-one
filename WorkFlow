BEGIN WORKFLOW
-------------------------------------------------------
Clone the Repo to local machine:
$ git clone https://github.com/bendgame/Project-one.git

Make sure the local master is up-to-date:
$ git pull origin master

Create new branch:
$ git banch branch_name

Move to branch:
$ git checkout branch_name

Navigate file structure as needed:
$ ls 
$ cd folder_name

Add the files to the branch:
$ git add .

Verify file: 
$ git status

Commit the files:
$ git commit -m "comment"

Add branch and files to the Remote Repo:
$ git push -u origin branch_name

Go to the github website to manage pull request and merge. 

Switch back to local master so you can delete the local branch:
$ git checkout master

Delete local branch: 
$ git branch -d branch_name
OR 
$ git branch -D branch_name

------------------------------------------------
If you don't want to go to the website, you can merge your branch 
to the master locally and push the new master to the remote repo:
------------------------------------------------

Switch back to master branch:
$ git checkout master

Merge the branch with the local master:
$ git merge branch_name -m "comment"

Push the local master to the remote master:
$ git push origin master

Delete local branch: 
$ git branch -d branch_name
OR 
$ git branch -D branch_name
